## Hi, I'm Manal! 

As a Computer Science major at the University of San Francisco, Iâ€™m passionate about exploring technology through creativity, problem-solving, and impactful projects. As a Black Scholar at USF, Iâ€™m part of a community dedicated to academic excellence and social justice, which fuels my drive to contribute meaningfully to both my field and community.  

With my background and experiences, Iâ€™ve developed a diverse skill set in areas like coding, team collaboration, and project design. I enjoy working with people and bringing ideas to life through both technical and creative solutions. Outside of my studies, I value mentoring, community involvement, and the opportunity to connect with others in ways that are impactful and meaningful.  

Iâ€™m excited about exploring new opportunities to apply my skills, grow, and collaborate with like-minded individuals passionate about using technology to make a difference.
